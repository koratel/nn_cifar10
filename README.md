# CIFAR-10 classification

Project for the Neural Networks course.

> An ultimate goal of the course project is to develop an automatic classifier based on machine learning techniques that is able to distinguish between 10 types of images available at the CIFAR-10 dataset: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

> The dataset consists of 32x32 color images of different animals and vehicles compressed to a single file. Every such image contains exactly one object in the foreground and is assigned a label, e.g. “cat”, “airplane”, or “frog”.

Information about my attempts and results can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/koratel/nn_cifar10/wiki).
